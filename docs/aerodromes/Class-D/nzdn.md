## Airspace

The Dunedin CTR/D follows the inner lateral boundries shown below from `SFC` to `A035`. The CTR/D is comprised of three sectors - West, East and Instrument. The Dunedin CTA/D follows the outer lateral boundary as shown below. To the North, South and East, the airspace is from `A035` to `A095`. To the West the airspace is from `A045` to `A095` then `A075` to `A135` as seen in the diagram below.

### Transfer of Control points

IFR traffic departing via BIDEL shall be handed off to STH either crossing BIDEL or passing `A095`. Other IFR departures shall be handed off either crossing the lateral boundary of the airspace or passing the upper limit of `A095` or `A135`.

## NZTI - Taieri

Taieri is a small GA aerodrome located 8nm Northeast of NZDN (Dunedin). ATC Clearence is not required for operations within 3nm of the aerodrome below `A011`. 

!!! info
    VFR aircraft bound for NZTI are to be handed off to Unicom approaching the aerodrome. A good rule of thumb for aircraft coming from the North, South or the city is to hand them off as they enter the Taieri Plains valley.


## Clearance Delivery

Clearances shall be issued by TDN, and may be given via DCL or voice.
