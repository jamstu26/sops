### Transfer of Control points

IFR traffic departing via BIDEL shall be handed off to STH either crossing BIDEL or passing `A095`. Other IFR departures shall be handed off either crossing the lateral boundary of the airspace or passing the upper limit of `A095` or `A135`.

## NZTI - Taieri

Taieri is a small GA aerodrome located 8nm Northeast of NZDN (Dunedin). ATC Clearence is not required for operations within 3nm of the aerodrome below `A011`. 

!!! info
    VFR aircraft bound for NZTI are to be handed off to Unicom approaching the aerodrome. A good rule of thumb for aircraft coming from the North, South or the city is to hand them off as they enter the valley (Taieri Plains).
